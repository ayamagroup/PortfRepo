## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.

The Gaming Room client sought to transform their Android game, "Draw It or Lose It," into a web-based multi-platform application. They required a design that would maintain the original game mechanics while introducing unique game and team names, ensuring optimal memory management, and allowing for multiple teams and players.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing this documentation, I believe I excelled in providing a comprehensive breakdown of the requirements, design constraints, and system architecture. The inclusion of a detailed evaluation table, which compared development requirements across different platforms, was particularly effective in highlighting the strengths and challenges of each platform.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document was instrumental in providing a clear roadmap for the development process. It helped in understanding the client's vision, setting clear objectives, and identifying potential challenges. This foresight allowed for better planning and a more streamlined coding process.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise a section, I'd choose the "Design Constraints" section. While it does cover the primary constraints, I believe it could benefit from a deeper dive into potential challenges, especially regarding scalability and user experience consistency across different browsers and devices.

## How did you interpret the userâ€™s needs and implement them into your software design?

Interpreting user needs was achieved by closely analyzing the client's requirements and understanding the end-users' expectations. By prioritizing user experience and ensuring the game mechanics remained consistent, the design catered to both the client's vision and the users' familiarity with the game. Considering user needs is paramount as it ensures the software is user-friendly, intuitive, and meets the intended purpose.

## How did you approach designing software?

The software design approach was systematic, starting with a clear understanding of requirements, followed by mapping out the system architecture and domain model. Techniques such as UML diagrams and the application of software design patterns, like Singleton, were used. In the future, I'd consider incorporating user feedback earlier in the design phase and employing iterative design methodologies to ensure continuous improvement and alignment with user needs.
